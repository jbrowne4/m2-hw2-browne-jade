<h3>Interests</h3>
<p>I am interested in combining my skills as a teacher to the web design and UX field. I am excited to learn more about coding and web principles in this course.</p>

<h3>Why UX?</h3>
<p>For as long as I can remember, I have always loved the arts. Digital design became a quick avenue that I started learning with its usage of artistic creativity and technology advances. I chose to major in English for my bachelor’s because of my love for storytelling and furthered my study with a master’s in English education. As a lifelong learner, I aim to help students find their voice and address the current downward trends in literacy. While my role may change, the vision does not. Literacy and storytelling take many forms because of the wide variety of definitions of literature. Today's digital landscape intertwines UX/UI, graphic, and web design. Mastering code, design, and strategic communication principles through this program is vital for an effective transition into UX design. Understanding visual elements, layouts, and interactivity in both realms enriches my ability to create intuitive, user-focused experiences.  </p>
